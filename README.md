# Final-Project-Group8

   All planets in our solar system orbit around the sun. Planets that orbit around other stars are called exoplanets. There’s a lot of questions that motivate the study of exoplanets, such as how do we look for exoplanets, how can we find Earth-like planets in other solar systems, how many exoplanets exist, how diverse are exoplanets, what kind of physical character do exoplanets contain, etc. Thousands of exoplanets have been discovered within the past 20 years. Because exoplanets are hidden by the bright glare of the stars they orbit, they are very difficult to see directly with telescopes. NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope was launched, and was mostly used to obtain these discoveries. Although the Kepler mission ended in 2018, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) took over to find new exoplanets. 
  
  
   Since NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope data is still publically available, it’s possible to make predictions about which exoplanets might be susceptible to life. The goal of this project is to develop neural networks to successfully model data for the detection of exoplanets. Using Keras as the deep learning framework, these models will be able to predict the existence of an exoplanet utilizing the flux (light intensity) readings. Previously, others have researched the same topic and uploaded kernels of their work on Kaggle. We decided to use neural networks such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional (CNN) and recurrent (RNN) as an aid to build our own models.  In order to improve our models’ performance to our best capability, we tried different preprocessing methods and focused on addressing overfitting problems, which allowed us to evaluate our models from several perspectives.
